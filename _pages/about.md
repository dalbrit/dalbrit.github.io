In 2020-21, I will be an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow at the Courant Institute at NYU. Afterward, I will be at the Institute for Advanced Study and Princeton University.

My research interests are in partial differential equations, especially the Navier-Stokes equations and other PDEs arising in fluid dynamics. Currently, I am focused on regularity aspects of the Navier-Stokes equations.

I recently completed my PhD in Mathematics at the University of Minnesota under the supervision of Vladimír Šverák. At Minnesota, I was supported by an NDSEG Fellowship through the Department of Defense.
